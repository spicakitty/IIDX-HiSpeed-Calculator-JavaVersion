## What are these values
- GN (Green Number) is the amount of milliseconds that a note stays on the screen for.
- WN (White Number) is the amount of the screen that is obscured by SUDDEN+ (out of a 1000)
- Screen Limits are WN values that are equivalent to the edge of your TV screen. The values present in this archive correspond to the values I approximated on my CRT TV.
