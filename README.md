## What are these values
- **GN** (Green Number) is the amount of milliseconds that a note stays on the screen for.
- **WN** (White Number) is the amount of the screen that is obscured by SUDDEN+ (out of a 1000)
- **ScreenLimits** are WN values that are equivalent to the edge of your TV screen. The values present in this archive correspond to the values I approximated on my CRT TV.
- **HiSpeed** is the option you would select in the game.
- **Multiplier** is the actual magnification value of the HiSpeed option.
- **Max BPM** is the highest BPM you could use each HiSpeed option on without having to read too fast.
- **Towel** is the amount of the playfield you would block physically with a towel (out of a 1000). This value is different from the White Number because it takes the screenlimits into account.
